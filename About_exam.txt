 Tips to Succeed in HTB CBBH Exam

    Practice proper recon: Don’t rush to exploit — look for misconfigurations, hidden endpoints, and subtle logic flaws.
    Think like a developer: The exam is more about bypassing logic than brute-forcing.
    Document everything as you go: You’ll need this for your report. No partial credit if you forget how you did something.
    Stay calm under pressure: You don’t need all 5 vulnerabilities — 3 good ones can earn you the cert.
    Use your HTB notes: HTB lets you use your Academy notes and knowledge base during the exam. Use them smartly.
