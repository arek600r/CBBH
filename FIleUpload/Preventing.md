Further Security

The above tips should significantly reduce the chances of uploading and accessing a malicious file. We can take a few other measures to ensure that the back-end server is not compromised if any of the above measures are bypassed.

A critical configuration we can add is disabling specific functions that may be used to execute system commands through the web application. For example, to do so in PHP, we can use the disable_functions configuration in php.ini and add such dangerous functions, like exec, shell_exec, system, passthru, and a few others.

Another thing we should do is to disable showing any system or server errors, to avoid sensitive information disclosure. We should always handle errors at the web application level and print out simple errors that explain the error without disclosing any sensitive or specific details, like the file name, uploads directory, or the raw errors.

Finally, the following are a few other tips we should consider for our web applications:

    Limit file size
    Update any used libraries
    Scan uploaded files for malware or malicious strings
    Utilize a Web Application Firewall (WAF) as a secondary layer of protection

Once we perform all of the security measures discussed in this section, the web application should be relatively secure and not vulnerable to common file upload threats. When performing a web penetration test, we can use these points as a checklist and provide any missing ones to the developers to fill any remaining gaps.
